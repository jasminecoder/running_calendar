# Raw Idea

**Race Cards List Page** — Build the main landing page displaying race cards ordered by upcoming date, with each card showing the race photo, name, date, distance and location

This is roadmap item 3 (Size: M).

Context from roadmap notes:
- Mobile-first: All public-facing pages should be optimized for mobile phone users (runners checking races on the go)
- This delivers core runner value as part of the MVP
