# Product Mission

## Pitch

Running Calendar is a mobile-first web platform in Spanish that helps runners in Northern Baja California discover upcoming races by providing a simple, visual list of race cards with essential event details and direct links to registration.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Runners**: Active runners seeking upcoming race events in their local area
- **Race Organizers**: Event coordinators who want to promote their races to the running community

### User Personas

**Carlos the Casual Runner** (28-45)
- **Role:** Weekend runner, participates in 3-5 races per year
- **Context:** Lives in Tijuana, works full-time, runs for fitness and community
- **Pain Points:** Misses races because he didn't know about them in time; finds race information scattered across Facebook groups and word-of-mouth
- **Goals:** Easily find upcoming races, plan training around race dates, discover new events

**Maria the Race Organizer** (35-55)
- **Role:** Event coordinator for local running clubs or race companies
- **Context:** Organizes 2-4 races per year in the Baja California region
- **Pain Points:** Struggles to reach runners outside her immediate network; relies heavily on social media which has limited reach
- **Goals:** Get her races in front of more runners, increase registration numbers, build event awareness

## The Problem

### Race Discovery is Fragmented

Runners in Northern Baja California have no centralized place to discover upcoming races. Information is scattered across Facebook groups, Instagram posts, WhatsApp chains, and word-of-mouth. Runners frequently miss races they would have enjoyed because they simply didn't hear about them in time.

**Our Solution:** A single, mobile-optimized destination where runners can browse all upcoming races in their region, see key details at a glance, and access registration links.

### Race Organizers Lack Visibility

Small and medium-sized race organizers struggle to reach runners beyond their existing networks. Without a dedicated platform, they rely on social media algorithms and hope their posts get shared.

**Our Solution:** A submission system that allows organizers to request their races be added to the platform, giving them exposure to an engaged audience of local runners.

## Differentiators

### Mobile-First, Purpose-Built Design

Unlike Facebook events or generic event platforms, Running Calendar is designed specifically for runners on mobile devices. The card-based interface shows exactly what runners need: race photo, name, date, location, and distance - no clutter, no distractions.

### Regional Focus

By focusing specifically on Northern Baja California (Tijuana, Rosarito, Tecate, Mexicali), we provide curated, relevant content rather than overwhelming users with races they'll never attend.

### Visual Race Cards

Instead of text-heavy listings or traditional calendar grids, our visual card format makes browsing races engaging and helps runners quickly identify events that interest them.

## Key Features

### Core Features

- **Race Cards List:** Browse upcoming races in a visually appealing card format, ordered by date, making it easy to see what's coming up next
- **Race Card Details:** View comprehensive race information including photo, name, date, location, distance, registration links, and other relevant details
- **Race Submission Request:** Allow race organizers to submit their events for inclusion on the platform

### Future Considerations

- **City/Region Filtering:** Filter races by specific city within the coverage area
- **Distance Filtering:** Filter races by distance (5K, 10K, half marathon, marathon, ultra)
- **Calendar Integration:** Add races to personal calendar apps
- **Registration Reminders:** Notify users when registration opens or closes for races they've saved

## Geographic Scope

### Launch Markets
We'll initially start in these markets, all of which are spanish speaking:
- Tijuana
- Rosarito
- Tecate
- Mexicali

### Expansion Strategy

Start with Northern Baja California to validate the concept and build a quality database of races, then consider expanding to other Mexican cities based on demand and operational capacity.
